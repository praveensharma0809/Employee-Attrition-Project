# Employee Attrition Project

This project analyzes employee data to identify key reasons for attrition.  
I used Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib and ML Models (Random-Forests) to explore the data and visualize trends.

## Files
- `Employee_Attrition_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with analysis.
- `employee_data.csv`: Dataset used.

## Key Findings
- Monthly Income, Working Overtime and Age are important factors.
- Visualized data to understand correlations and trends.
